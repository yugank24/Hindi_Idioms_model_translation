For Linux/macOS: Run the following command:
git lfs install
For Windows: You can download the installer from Git LFS website, or use choco (if you have Chocolatey installed) to install it:
choco install git-lfs

2. Clone the repository
After installing Git LFS, you can clone the repository as usual:

git clone https://github.com/yugank24/Hindi_Idioms_model_translation.git
Git LFS will automatically download the large files during the cloning process. If you don’t have Git LFS installed, you’ll just see pointers to the LFS files instead of the actual content.

3. Verify the LFS files
Once the repository is cloned, you can verify that the LFS files are properly downloaded by running:

git lfs pull
This will ensure that all LFS files are fetched from the remote repository.

4. Working with LFS files
You can now work with the repository as you normally would. Any changes to LFS files will be automatically handled by Git LFS.
